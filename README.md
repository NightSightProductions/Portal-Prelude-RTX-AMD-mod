# Portal Prelude RTX AMD mod
At NightSightProductions, we’re dedicated to bringing Portal Prelude RTX to AMD players of all kinds. This mod allows you to experience high-quality visuals on AMD hardware, without needing an RTX GPU.
With a custom DXVK patch for better performance and FSR 3.1 support, we’ve also created a range of graphical presets designed to optimize performance across a variety of AMD hardware. You’ll find detailed instructions in the included README file.

Whether you're aiming for smooth frame rates or high resolutions, this mod has you covered. We hope you enjoy our work, and we look forward to seeing you explore more of our projects in the future.

 If you need support with anything, we now have a Discord: https://discord.gg/GKacpbpyQb
