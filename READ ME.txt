FSR 3.1 can be toggled through ALT + X and changing upscaler to DLSS

Warning: While in ALT + X dev menu, do not go to the remix graphics menu, this will revert some changes and reduce performance (Only if using TAA-U or NIS, Does not affect FSR)

 If you need support, you can join our discord through the mod site

  How to know your architecture:
   RDNA 2: 6000 series, 600m series
   RDNA 3: 7000 series, 700m series

   *to fix dark areas, go to post processing in the dev menu and change eye adaptation from median to mean

 We would love feedback for other GPUs
